# CDN 2025 Election Sentiment Analysis w/ Reddit Data

Traditional polling methods often fail to capture the complexity and speed of evolving public sentiment. This project investigates how Reddit can be used to track public perceptions of Canadian federal party leaders through sentiment analysis. We collected over 4,800 posts and 487,000 comments from politically active subreddits between March 2024 and February 2025, filtering for relevance to federal politics and processing the data for sentiment and topic analysis. Using a pre-trained BERT transformer model, we analyzed sentiment trends over time, complemented by monthly topic modeling with BERTopic. Our pipeline identifies mentions of key leaders and parties (Trudeau, Poilievre, Carney, Singh; LPC, CPC, NDP), correlates sentiment with political topics, and visualizes changes in public opinion. Our pipeline shows mentions of key leaders and parties, correlates sentiment with political topics and shows changes in public opinion across a twelve-month period. Although not every Canadian subreddit was included in our analyses, our findings show clear patterns in candidate visibility, issue salience and sentiment dynamics within these communities. We believe that this project could be further expanded to cover more, if not all Canadian sub-reddit communities to provide a more holistic reference point on national public sentiment.
